# ‚úÖ Database Saving Fixed - FitTrack Application

## üéâ Issues Resolved

Your FitTrack application now **properly saves data to the SQLite database** in your project folder!

---

## üîß What Was Fixed?

### 1. **NULL Value Handling in Database Updates**

**Problem:** SQLite handles NULL values differently than MySQL. When saving user profiles, goals, or other data with optional fields, the application was using `setObject()` which caused issues with NULL values.

**Solution:** Updated all database save methods to explicitly handle NULL values:

```java
// Before (caused errors):
pstmt.setObject(1, user.age);

// After (works correctly):
if (user.age != null) {
    pstmt.setInt(1, user.age);
} else {
    pstmt.setNull(1, java.sql.Types.INTEGER);
}
```

### 2. **Updated Methods:**
- ‚úÖ `updateUserProfile()` - Saves profile data (age, gender, height, weight, fitness level)
- ‚úÖ `saveGoal()` - Saves fitness goals
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging to track save operations

## üîç How to Verify Data is Saved

### Option 1: Run Verification Script
```powershell
mvn compile exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="com.fittrack.VerifyData"
```

This will show all data in your database.

### Option 2: Check Database File
```powershell
# Check if file exists and its size
dir fittrack.db
```

A database with data should be **57 KB or larger** (not 0 bytes).

### Option 3: Use DB Browser for SQLite
1. Download: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
2. Open `fittrack.db`
3. Browse tables: users, goals, workout_plans, weight_history, food_log

## üéØ Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Login** with your username
- [ ] **Update Profile** - Add age, height, weight
- [ ] **Check Terminal Output** - Should see "‚úì Profile updated"
- [ ] **Logout and Login Again** - Data should still be there!
- [ ] **Add a Goal** - Should see "‚úì Goal saved"
- [ ] **Add Weight Entry** - Should save to progress
- [ ] **Add Food Entry** - Should save to food log

---

## üìä Debug Output

When you save data, you'll see console messages like:

```
DEBUG: Updating profile for user ID: 1
DEBUG: Age=25, Gender=Male, Height=175.0, Weight=70.0, FitnessLevel=intermediate
‚úì Database connected: fittrack.db
‚úì Profile updated for user: ranzel_j (rows affected: 1)
```

This confirms data is being saved!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Data not saving"
**Solution:**
1. Check console output for errors
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" button
3. Verify database file exists: `dir fittrack.db`

### Issue: "Database file is 0 bytes"
**Solution:**
1. Delete `fittrack.db`
2. Restart application
3. It will recreate with proper tables

### Issue: "Can't see saved data after restart"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logging in with the same username
2. Check if data is actually in database using VerifyData script
