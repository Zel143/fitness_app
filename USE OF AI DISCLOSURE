AI Tool Used: GitHub Copilot Chat
Purpose: Debugging and optimization assistant

Specific Contributions:
1. SQLite Migration (DatabaseManager.java, lines 16-27)
   - Diagnosed getGeneratedKeys() incompatibility
   - Suggested last_insert_rowid() alternative
   - I implemented and tested the solution

2. NULL Handling (DatabaseManager.java, lines 227-294)
   - Identified setNull(Types.X) requirement for SQLite
   - I applied the pattern across all save methods

3. Controller Sync Pattern (ProgressController.java, lines 147-208)
   - Suggested reload pattern instead of manual list manipulation
   - I implemented and verified data persistence

All core functionality, database design, UI/UX, and business logic 
were developed independently. AI assisted with debugging and 
optimization only.
