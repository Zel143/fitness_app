# ✅ SQLite Migration Complete!

Your FitTrack application now uses **SQLite** - a file-based database instead of MySQL.

---

## 🎉 What Changed?

### Before (MySQL):
- ❌ Required MySQL server installation
- ❌ Required database setup and configuration
- ❌ Needed username/password authentication
- ❌ Network connection required

### After (SQLite):
- ✅ **No server installation needed**
- ✅ **Automatic database creation**
- ✅ **Single file storage** (~100KB-10MB)
- ✅ **No configuration required**
- ✅ **Portable** - copy the file anywhere!

---

## 📂 Database Location

Your database file is stored at:

**Windows:** `C:\Users\YourUsername\FitTrack\fittrack.db`
**Mac/Linux:** `~/FitTrack/fittrack.db`

The application will **automatically create** this file the first time you run it.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```powershell
mvn clean install
```

### Step 2: Run the Application
```powershell
mvn javafx:run
```

That's it! The database will be created automatically.

---

## 📊 Database Management

### View Your Database
You can open the database file with:
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (Free, GUI): https://sqlitebrowser.org/
- **DBeaver** (Free, Multi-database): https://dbeaver.io/

### Backup Your Database
Simply copy the `fittrack.db` file to another location!

```powershell
# Windows
copy "%USERPROFILE%\FitTrack\fittrack.db" "C:\Backups\fittrack-backup.db"

# Mac/Linux
cp ~/FitTrack/fittrack.db ~/Backups/fittrack-backup.db
```

### Reset Your Database
Delete the file and it will be recreated on next run:

```powershell
# Windows
del "%USERPROFILE%\FitTrack\fittrack.db"

# Mac/Linux
rm ~/FitTrack/fittrack.db
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. **pom.xml**
- ✅ Removed MySQL driver dependency
- ✅ Added SQLite JDBC driver (`org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.44.1.0`)

### 2. **DatabaseManager.java**
- ✅ Changed connection URL from `jdbc:mysql://...` to `jdbc:sqlite:...`
- ✅ Removed username/password authentication
- ✅ Updated SQL syntax:
  - `INT AUTO_INCREMENT` → `INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT`
  - `VARCHAR(n)` → `TEXT`
  - `DOUBLE` → `REAL`
  - `DECIMAL(n,m)` → `REAL`
  - `ENUM(...)` → `TEXT`
  - Removed `ENGINE=InnoDB`

### 3. **.gitignore**
- ✅ Modified to allow tracking database file (optional)

## 🎯 Advantages of SQLite

1. **Zero Configuration** - No server setup needed
2. **Portable** - Entire database in one file
3. **Fast** - Perfect for single-user desktop apps
4. **Reliable** - Used by billions of devices (iOS, Android, browsers)
5. **No Network** - Works offline, no network overhead
6. **Easy Backup** - Just copy the file!

---

## ⚠️ Limitations to Know

1. **Single Writer** - Only one process can write at a time (fine for desktop apps)
2. **Not for Web Apps** - Best for desktop/mobile apps with 1 user
3. **No User Management** - No built-in user accounts (handled by your app)

For FitTrack (a personal fitness tracker), SQLite is **perfect**! 💪

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Database

Run the database setup test:

```powershell
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.fittrack.DatabaseSetup"
```

Or run the test connection:

```powershell
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.fittrack.TestConnection"
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Database file size:** Starts small (~100KB), grows with data
- **Performance:** Very fast for thousands of records
- **Thread-safe:** Yes, built-in connection pooling
- **ACID compliant:** Yes, full transaction support

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your FitTrack application is now simpler, more portable, and easier to use!

Just run `mvn javafx:run` and start tracking your fitness! 💪
