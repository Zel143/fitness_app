## 📊 Data Flow

### Current Implementation (Mock Data):
- Goals: Uses DatabaseManager (real database integration)
- Workout Plans: Uses mock data (3 sample plans)
- Progress: Uses mock data (5 weight entries)
- Food Log: Uses mock data (4 food entries)

### To Enable Full Database Integration:

You'll need to add these methods to `DatabaseManager.java`:

```java
// For Workout Plans
public boolean saveWorkoutPlan(WorkoutPlan plan) { ... }
public List<WorkoutPlan> getWorkoutPlans(int userId) { ... }
public boolean deleteWorkoutPlan(int planId) { ... }

// For Weight History
public boolean saveWeightHistory(WeightHistory entry) { ... }
public List<WeightHistory> getWeightHistory(int userId) { ... }
public boolean deleteWeightHistory(int historyId) { ... }

// For Food Log
public boolean saveFoodLog(FoodLog food) { ... }
public List<FoodLog> getFoodLog(int userId, LocalDate date) { ... }
public boolean deleteFoodLog(int foodLogId) { ... }
```
