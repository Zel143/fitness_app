## 🎯 Benefits

| Feature | MySQL (Before) | SQLite (After) |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Setup** | Complex (server install) | Zero setup |
| **Configuration** | Username/password required | None needed |
| **Portability** | Server-dependent | Single file |
| **Backup** | SQL dump commands | Copy file |
| **Deployment** | Server needed | File included |
| **Performance** | Network overhead | Direct file access |
| **Storage** | Separate server | User's home folder |

## 🛠️ How to Manage Database

### View Database Contents:
Download **DB Browser for SQLite** (free): https://sqlitebrowser.org/

### Backup Database:
```powershell
copy "$env:USERPROFILE\FitTrack\fittrack.db" "D:\Backups\fittrack-backup.db"
```

### Reset Database:
```powershell
del "$env:USERPROFILE\FitTrack\fittrack.db"
# Will be recreated on next app launch
```

### Share Database:
Just copy the `fittrack.db` file to another computer!

## 📊 Database Schema

All tables remain the same with identical relationships:

- **users** - User accounts and profiles
- **goals** - Fitness goals
- **workout_plans** - Custom workout plans
- **plan_exercises** - Exercises in workout plans
- **exercises** - Exercise library
- **workout_log** - Exercise history
- **weight_history** - Weight tracking
- **food_library** - Food database
- **food_log** - Daily food intake

Foreign keys and constraints preserved!

---

## 🧪 Verification Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies installed (`mvn clean install`)
2. ✅ Database file created (`C:\Users\Ranzel Jude Virtucio\FitTrack\fittrack.db`)
3. ✅ Tables created (9 tables)
4. ✅ Application runs successfully
5. ✅ Ready for user registration

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Register a new user** - Test user creation
2. **Add profile info** - Test data persistence
3. **Create goals** - Test CRUD operations
4. **Log workouts** - Test data entry
5. **Track progress** - Test data retrieval

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Single User:** SQLite is perfect for desktop apps (one user at a time)
- **Thread-Safe:** Built-in locking prevents data corruption
- **No Network:** Works offline, no internet needed
- **Automatic:** Database created automatically on first run
- **Portable:** Copy the file to move your data

---

## 🎉 Migration Status: COMPLETE ✅

Your application is now simpler, faster, and more portable!

**No server needed. No configuration. Just run and use!** 💪
